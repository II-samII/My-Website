        Perks of Teaching
        </h2>
        
        <p>Teaching and learning can be improved by using social media in education nowadays. Social media and technology has become a huge part of our daily lives with the majority of adults and teenagers with at least one or two different social media tools or apps which can be accessed from many devices. Since we all still use these apps, there are definitely ways to implement them into education. Some ways benefits and approaches to using social media in education are:</p>

        <p>1. Communication This one of the biggest advantages to social media, it gives great access to communicate to anyone around the world. Students can connect with their fellow students and teachers easily and from a wide range of devices from mobile phones to PCâ€™s.</p>

        <p>2. Collaboration Students and teachers can collaborate easily through tools and apps such as Google Drive and Google Docs, making it easy to access files and documents that the whole class needs.</p>
    
        <p>3. Finding information and inspiration Students can use social media to find information and be up to date to current events through apps such as Twitter. They can find inspiration for projects through sites and apps like Tumblr and Pinterest.</p>

        <p>4. Parents Involvement Social Media in Education also helps parents to be connected and involved in the students learning. If the school has a Twitter or Facebook page, parents and students can follow to be updated on the latest news, projects and achievements.</p>
    
        <p>5. Improved Literacy, Communication and Reading Skill Students are known to get bored with writing and reading with books and paper. Social media gives them access to information online which can be more catchy and interesting to read. It gives students a different medium to learn which can help with making learning easier.</p>
