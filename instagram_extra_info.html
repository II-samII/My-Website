        <p>Instagram is a social app that can be used for teaching and learning in Education. There are over 1 Billion users on instagram with 72% being teenagers. 35% of the teenagers in the US said that Instagram is their preferred social media platform. This just shows that instagram has a huge potential to be used in Education. One of the first things a teacher should do if wanting to use Instagram as an educational tool is to set up a private classroom account which every student can join and follow. Then following from that, here are a few examples of how Instagram can be used for the purpose of Education in a classroom:</p>
        
        </div>
        
        <div class="extra1"><p>A great way teachers can find new and interesting ideas to use in class would be to search aroundon Instagram, there are many teacher and educational accounts around that can be followed and provide great ideas. Following the hashtag #teachersofinstagram will help a teacher find thoseaccounts easily.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="extra2"><p>A teacher can post pictures of a lot of the memories made in class. This can be from regular days inclass, to going on a trip or completing cool activities. This can remind the students of these memories and also allow their parents to see all the interesting things their children are doing at school.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="extra3"><p>Instagram is a perfect place to showcase students&#39; works and achievements, since it works on abasis of posting pictures with a caption underneath. The class account can act as a place to post award winning projects and achievements that the students have made.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="extra4"><p>Teachers can use Instagram to help students by posting homework and reminders for projects.They can also post useful tutorials or links to useful sites that the students can use to learn. Thecomments section can also be used to engage the whole classroom and students can learn of oneanother that way too. The Direct Messages can also be useful when a student needs to ask aquestion relating to a post privately if they don't want to comment.</p> 
      </div>
      <div class="extra5"><p>Instagram can be used in many different ways depending on the subject being taught. Some examples are as following: Science Students can take photos or videos of experiments that they are doing in school and post on Instagram, from there they could all comment on each others posts and examine each others results and differences. Teachers can also join and give critical feedback. Art Students can use Instagram to create a photo gallery of their photos or projects in art class. This gives parents, students and teachers to see their work, like and comment. It can also lead to them gaining followers that like their work and build a future portfolio and following which will be useful in the future. Music Similar to Art, students can post short clips of themselves playing an instrument or singing. They can also make small tutorials for fellow classmates that might want to learn an instrument. They could also post and ask followers for opinions on a cover of a song or an original.</p></div>
